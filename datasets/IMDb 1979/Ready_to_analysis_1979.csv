The crew are under obligation to investigate and the spaceship descends on the moon afterwards. After a rough landing, three crew members leave the spaceship to explore the area on the moon.

There is great animosity between the cutters and the generally wealthy Indiana University students, each group who have their own turf in town. The dichotomy is that the limestone was used to build the university, which is now seen as being too good for the locals who built it. Although each of the four is a totally different personality from the other three, they also have in common the fact of being unfocused and unmotivated in life. The one slight exception is Dave.

Ben finds that the Marsten House has just been rented to the antique dealers Richard K. Straker and his partner Kurt Barlow that is permanently traveling.

He has just built a time machine which he is displaying to a group of skeptical friends, including surgeon Dr. John Leslie Stevenson. Unbeknown to Wells or anyone else among that circle, Stevenson is better known to the public as Jack the Ripper. Just as the police are about to capture Stevenson, he uses the time machine to escape, with Wells being the only one who knows what happened to him. Not telling anyone except his trusting housekeeper, Wells follows Stevenson in order to capture and bring him back to face justice. Where Stevenson has gone is 1979 San Francisco.

He is seriously dating thirty-eight year old actress and singer Samantha Taylor (Dame Julie Andrews), who he loves, although he admits their connection is more intellectual than it is emotional. She, in turn, loves him, despite barely tolerating his often infantile behavior. This behavior includes spying on a neighbor's sexual encounters with a wide array of women, this spying about which the neighbor knows, as he does it himself. Driving one day, George spots a young woman who he believes is the most beautiful creature he's ever seen - an ""eleven"" on a scale of ten, tens which he didn't believe existed before her.

Slight comedy, slight High School angst and every bit entertaining with its classic 1950's Rock n' Roll soundtrack such as ""Walk Like a Man"", ""Big Girls Don't Cry"" by The Four Seasons and ""My Boyfriend's Back"" by The Angels.

This movie follows Rose's career during her last tour, as she's determined to return to her Florida hometown. Although a success, she's exhausted and lonely, but continued working by her gruff and greedy manager. Though loud and brassy, Rose is an insecure alcoholic and former drug user who seems to crave approval in her life. She begins a romance with a limousine driver, who's actually an A.W.O.L. Sergeant from the United States Army. Her rock and roll lifestyle of sex, drugs, and rock and roll, and constant touring, lead her to an inevitable breakdown.","roses,bath house,year 1969,wrapped in a bedsheet,unfaithfulness,two word title,title spoken by character,strange behavior,stopwatch,songwriter,song,singing,singer,signing an autograph,self destructiveness,sauna,rock music,rock 'n' roll,rise and fall,returning home,reference to the young republicans,reference to sarah lee,reference to paul newman,reference to mae west,reference to green bay packers,reference to diana ross,reference to chevrolet,reference to barbra streisand,redneck,record industry,pulled on stage,private plane,price of fame,popularity,pop singer,polish joke,overwork,music business,mob of reporters,male nudity,male female relationship,loosely based on real events,lesbian,infidelity,impatient audience,hotel,helicopter,hairy chest,gold record,gay club,female singer,female protagonist,female impersonator,f rated,extramarital affair,drunkenness,drunken argument,drugs,drug addiction,driver,drag queen,diva,diner,depression,dependence,demand,country singer,concert,chauffeur,character name in title,chanting,blues,bare chested male,bar fight,backstage,awol,autograph,attention,artist,argument in car,ambition,alcoholism,after party,adultery,addict","2.0,2.0,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan","USA,Australia,UK,West Germany,Sweden,Finland,Denmark,Spain,Netherlands,Argentina,Belgium,France,Portugal,Colombia,Japan,East Germany,Greece,Greece,France","7 November 1979,31 January 1980,7 February 1980,8 February 1980,19 February 1980,22 February 1980,29 February 1980,1 April 1980,3 April 1980,8 May 1980,29 May 1980,4 June 1980,19 June 1980,30 October 1980,15 November 1980,14 May 1982,18 April 2003,18 April 2004,29 July 2015","['New York City,New York,USA', 'Stage 11,20th Century Fox Studios - 10201 Pico Blvd.,Century City,Los Angeles,California,USA', 'The Wiltern - 3790 Wilshire Blvd.,Los Angeles,California,USA', 'Veterans Memorial Stadium - 508 E.

But the theft of a priceless deity of Lord Ganesh (the Elephant God) from a local household forces him to start investigation. Feluda comes in direct confrontation with Maganlal Meghraj (Utpal Dutt), a ruthless trader. Maganlal makes the mild-mannered Lalmohan a knife-thrower's target and threatens Felu to stop investigation. But there are several other suspects as an innocent artisan is brutally murdered, a shady 'holy man' holds court on the banks of the Ganges and an adventure-loving little boy (and his grand-father), brought up on crime thrillers. The climax is a shoot-out on the Ganges, followed by the unraveling of the mystery.","vacation,thief,theft,reference to tintin,private detective,murder,knife throwing,knife thrower,knife,investigation,grandfather grandson relationship,friendship,friend,death,cousin cousin relationship,character name in title,based on novel","nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan","India,France,France,Portugal","5 January 1979,13 April 1994,9 April 2014,29 September 2014","['Benares,Varanasi,Uttar Pradesh,India', 'Varanasi,Uttar Pradesh,India', 'Calcutta,West Bengal,India']",,,,"Family,Adventure,Crime",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,India,[0.8033330548179488],[3.1856183958620465],0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,Bengali,[68.0],[277000000.0],0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,India,1979-01-05,,,,,,,,,,,,,Satyajit Ray,[3990000.0],"Satyajit Ray,Satyajit Ray","[842000.0, 842000.0]",,"Soumitra Chatterjee,Parinita Banerjee,Haradhan Bannerjee",,"[319000.0, 408000.0, 31200.0]",['RDB and Company'],[nan],,,{'United Kingdom': 'PG'},0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,8.0,1517.0,8.2,8.0,,,7,14,1.3,19.0,0.4,6.0,0.1,2.0,0.7,11.0,1.8,28.0,6.3,96.0,14.6,222.0,28.5,432.0,20.2,306.0,26.1,396.0,5.2,49.0,7.6,158.0,7.9,743.0,1518.0,8.0,3.0,8.7,355.0,8.4,609.0,8.0,168.0,6.3,1116.0,8.0,3.0,8.7,334.0,8.4,576.0,8.0,149.0,6.3,70.0,7.9,,,18.0,8.4,29.0,7.9,17.0,6.9

Cain is a strategic genius, but is bent on destroying the Cylons while Adama is happy to acquire fuel and escape, thus keeping his fleet alive to find Earth. When Cain sabotages a mission to obtain fuel, the Galactica and Pegasus are forced to attack a Cylon Base World and three Baseships. While the Galactica stays on to attack the planet, the Pegasus leaves to engage the Baseships (against orders). After the battle, the Pegasus just keeps on going into deep space and is never heard from again.

It is first determined to be an accident, but Inspector Max Hormung later deduces that Roffe was murdered. Sam's daughter Elizabeth assumes control of the company, and while traveling through Europe she immediately becomes a target as well. Suspicion falls on the Roffe cousins, all of whom want to go public with the company and sell their stock at a huge profit.

The women are mainly disillusioned with life or estranged from husbands while the youngest has a crush on him.","reminiscence,the past,sister sister relationship,self reflection,resignation,rifle in mouth,wound,wolf,whistling,warsaw poland,victrola,utopia,uncle nephew relationship,train,tomb,telescope,tears,tea,strawberry,storytelling,stable,shotgun,sheep,river,rifle,reference to rene descartes,reference to immanuel kant,reference to giorgione,reference to georg wilhelm friedrich hegel,raft,pulling weeds,priest,pony and cart,polish soviet war,poetry,poet,pneumonia,pigsty,pig,picnic,piano player,piano duet,piano,philosophy,passion,old flame,nun,nudity,nightshirt,mother son relationship,mother daughter relationship,morality,memory,manor house,male female relationship,lost youth,lawyer,law office,kitchen,kiss,kiev russia,journey to the past,jealousy,jam the preserve,injection,immortality,husband wife relationship,humiliation,horse riding,horse and wagon,horse and carriage,horse,hope,happiness,gun,greenhouse,graveyard,grave,garden,funeral,friendship,friend,french,flirting,fertilizer,ferry,female nudity,farm,family relationships,ex boyfriend ex girlfriend relationship,electricity,duck hunt,dog,doctor,divorce,death of father,death,dancing,dancer,crying,cross,coward,country estate,cigarette smoking,cigarette holder,cigar smoking,churn,children,childhood friend,chicken,cemetery,catholic,captain,candle,calesthenics,burial,brother in law sister in law relationship,book,blindness,blind man's bluff game,birthday party,birthday,based on novel,barnyard,bare breasts,bandage,aunt nephew relationship,apology,1920s","2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan","Poland,France,Switzerland,Poland,USA,Finland,West Germany,Denmark,Spain,Italy,Spain,Sweden,Hungary,Portugal,East Germany,Japan,Greece,Poland","March 1979,30 May 1979,12 August 1979,4 September 1979,11 October 1979,2 November 1979,9 May 1980,26 August 1980,29 August 1980,December 1980,2 March 1981,27 March 1981,10 November 1983,13 September 1984,16 January 1987,17 May 1997,24 February 2008,21 September 2018","['Radachówka,Mazowieckie,Poland']",,,,"Drama,Romance",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,"Poland,France","[0.4925818631528984, 0.4558231392270996]","[0.7697132090677896, 0.5365056195597927]",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,"Polish,French","[66.9, 48.7]","[1940000000.0, 5260000000.0]",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,France,1979-05-30,,,,,,,,,,,,,Andrzej Wajda,[2630000.0],"Jaroslaw Iwaszkiewicz,Zbigniew Kaminski","[210000.0, 376000.0]",,"Daniel Olbrychski,Anna Seniuk,Maja Komorowska",,"[25300.0, 115000.0, 96300.0]","['Les Films Molière', 'Pierson Productions', 'Polish Corporation for Film Production', 'Zespól Filmowy ""X""']","[nan, nan, nan, nan]",,,"{'Argentina': '13', 'Finland': 'K-12', 'Portugal': 'M/12', 'Sweden': '11'}",0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,7.5,1078.0,7.6,8.0,,,6,2,1.4,15.0,0.9,10.0,1.1,12.0,2.5,27.0,5.3,57.0,10.1,109.0,20.8,224.0,25.8,278.0,18.2,196.0,13.9,150.0,6.2,73.0,7.5,119.0,7.5,699.0,1078.0,7.5,,,105.0,7.6,430.0,7.6,332.0,7.5,702.0,7.5,,,64.0,7.4,335.0,7.5,285.0,7.5,179.0,7.8,,,40.0,8.0,88.0,7.8,44.0,8.0

Adult siblings Felix Young and Eugenia Munster were born and raised in Europe and have a somewhat bohemian lifestyle reflective of their travels throughout Europe. Felix, who has little money, is interested in painting and the arts. Eugenia is a baroness by marriage. They decide to travel to New England to meet their maternal uncle and their three cousins, the Wentworths, for the first time, the Wentworths who live just outside of Boston.

It is one of the greatest spectacle that was filmed in Yugoslavia in the 20th century. In the spring of 1942, the German air force had complete dominance, not only in the sky of Yugoslavia, but also almost the whole of Europe. Partisans in Yugoslavia at that time had planes that are like other weapons snatched from the enemy. During the ''Third Offensive'', 1942, on planes of different types abducted by the enemy, these are people took unequal air battle, specifying the enemy blows where he thought he was invulnerable, thereby contributing to the final victory. This is a film about the creation of partisan aviation and its early struggles.

The background of two middle-aged people (Michel and Lydia) is gradually unfolded. Michel's wife is incurably ill. They had agreed that she would take her life on this day. All telephone cables were cut and Michel should leave France for months. But he goes forth and back between the airport and his home street. Once when opening the door of a taxi he destroys Lydia's shopping carrier. They sit down in a café while he writes her a check. During this night they will part and meet again several times. Half a year ago Lydia's husband had a car accident. Their daughter died and the husband got brain injury. His talk is incomprehensible. Tonight is his birthday.

He digs deeper and finds that the stewardess survived the crash into the ocean, but she is being held by criminals who are blackmailing the company responsible for the crash.

When Jim Jones becomes increasingly obsessed with the belief that the CIA is ""a wicked enemy"" who is out to get him, he emigrates with his congregation to Guyana, where he plans to create a utopia. But Jim Jones' utopia consists of a society where he demands his followers turn their minds, bodies and possessions over to him, one that is rife with orgies, physical violence, mental torture, and sexual abuse of children and adults. Ultimately, Jim Jones' paranoia reaches a fevered pitch that culminates in him taking savage action against his own congregation.","triple child murder,tragedy,throat slitting,suicide,sect,religion,psychotronic film,preacher,poison,people's temple,paranoia,nudity,murder of family,murder,mind control,mass suicide,jonestown mass suicide,jonestown guyana,guyana,female nudity,fanatic,dead children,cult leader,cult,congressman,christianity,brainwashing,based on true story,airfield","nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan","Mexico,Colombia,USA,West Germany,Denmark,Norway","20 September 1979,28 November 1979,25 January 1980,1982,28 February 1983,27 January 1984","['Guyana', 'San Francisco,California,USA', 'Acapulco,Guerrero,Mexico']",['28 February 1979 - 22 April 1979'],,,"Drama,Thriller",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,Mexico,[0.10294796457440393],[0.9557233488532184],0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"English,Spanish","[0.0, 57.0]","[5910000000.0, 2670000000.0]",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,USA,1980-01-25,,,166896527.0,$,1980-01-27,January 1980,3798102.0,$,,3798102.0,$,,René Cardona Jr.,[3410000.0],"René Cardona Jr.,René Cardona Jr.","[1660000.0, 1660000.0]","Stuart Whitman,Gene Barry,John Ireland,Joseph Cotten,Bradford Dillman,Jennifer Ashley,Yvonne De Carlo,Nadiuska,Tony Young,Erika Carlsson,Robert DoQui,Hugo Stiglitz,Carlos East,Eduardo Bea,Juan Luis Galiardo","Stuart Whitman,Gene Barry,John Ireland","Reverend James Johnson,Congressman Leo Ryan,Dave Cole,Richard Gable,Dr. Gary Shaw,Anna Kazan,Susan Ames,Leslie Stevens,Ron Harvey,Marilyn Johnson,Oliver Ross,Cliff Robson,Mike Sheldon,Reporter,Reporter","[2760000.0, 17300.0, 1560000.0, 107000.0, 106000000.0, 508000.0, 20300000.0, 15500000.0, 2860000.0, 31600.0, 118000000.0, 16800000.0, 178000.0, 84800.0, 411000.0]","['Care', 'Corporación Nacional Cinematográfica', 'Real productions International', 'Ízaro Films']","[nan, 426000.0, nan, nan]",R,18.0,"{'Australia': 'M', 'New Zealand': 'R18', 'Norway': '18', 'United Kingdom': 'X', 'United States': 'R', 'West Germany': 'Not Rated'}",0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,5.3,416.0,5.3,5.0,,,14,30,9.1,38.0,4.6,19.0,6.5,27.0,11.5,48.0,20.7,86.0,19.0,79.0,12.5,52.0,7.9,33.0,1.9,8.0,6.2,26.0,4.3,51.0,5.1,136.0,5.5,174.0,416.0,5.3,,,21.0,4.5,118.0,5.5,183.0,5.3,303.0,5.2,,,20.0,4.5,110.0,5.5,166.0,5.2,22.0,6.1,,,,,6.0,5.8,15.0,6.1

He's convinced his writing is of no lasting value, but he still has an ego, about his work and his masculine appeal. He's drawn to a museum guide he sees on his first afternoon, and when she appears at dinner, he tries charm. She reads widely, knows his work, loved it once and now finds it trivial; and she says so.

Once the film was completed, the actual scenes of ""The Happiest Days of Our Lives"" and ""Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2"" were combined into a new video, which now represents the music video for ""Another Brick in the Wall"".","worm,window,wall,tire swing,teacher,schoolyard,school,rock music,puppet,progressive rock,playground,pink floyd,music video,meat grinder,marionette,magnifying glass,hammer,children,british accent,british,brick,black british,70s music","nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan",UK,23 November 1979,"['Islington,London,England,UK']",,,,"Animation,Short,Music",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,UK,[0.41418763830543937],[0.4470723964757062],0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,English,[0.0],[5910000000.0],0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,UK,1979-11-23,,,,,,,,,,,,,Gerald Scarfe,[317000.0],,[],,,,[],['Harvest'],[nan],,,{},0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,8.4,256.0,8.2,9.0,,,,,3.1,8.0,0.8,2.0,1.2,3.0,0.8,2.0,2.3,6.0,7.4,19.0,8.6,22.0,20.7,53.0,19.9,51.0,35.2,90.0,8.2,41.0,8.6,46.0,8.3,110.0,256.0,8.4,1.0,9.0,40.0,8.6,85.0,8.1,56.0,8.5,168.0,8.5,1.0,9.0,34.0,8.9,75.0,8.3,49.0,8.3,20.0,8.3,,,5.0,6.2,8.0,7.6,6.0,9.6

In the first part of this film, adapted from a novel by Daniel Saint-Hamon, the Narbonis run a little grocery in Algeria and keep their noses out of politics entirely. They are content to mind their own business, in the hopes that others will be equally sensible. Thus, they are bewildered when, in 1962, they are forced to leave what has by now become their native land for the strange country of France. In the second half of the film, their adjustment to life in France is aided by the same stick-to-business attitudes which earlier gave them difficulty.

After the newsreel, this mini-series starts in the late 1930s in Leiden, where freshmen undergo the humiliation of the initiation rites of their fraternity.

In the ensuing celebration, a debate among the townspeople arises over which of the brothers has the best style, and the brothers become bitter rivals, neither of which is willing to admit that the other is his equal. Each sets up a martial arts school in the town. Years pass. A rich stranger comes to town with his two sons, and he places them in the two martial arts schools: One son in one school, and the other son in the other school. He vows to return in two years to test their knowledge.

But it also draws on the narrative style of Marguerite Duras as if retouched by Jean Genet. The title has been translated into English as Menthe - the blissful but it would probably be more accurate (if apparently awkward) to translate it as Mint - the blessed one. The question of the addressee's name is disputed through the dialogic narrative that unfolds as Menthe's history is elliptically told by the speaker who attempts to entice her to travel with her to the ""South"". Besides the ecstatically mutilated woman who reappears at the center of von Trier's Golden Heart trilogy and in the figures of ""Grace"" and ""She"", this film also introduces the Ascension motif which has its counterpart in the final shot of The Orchid Gardener also where the Dreyer-esque ""Jew"" appears to impale the film itself as if it were ""Vampyr"".","bdsm,based on novel","nan,nan",Greece,13 September 2001,,,,,Short,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,Denmark,[0.4459206798745717],[0.578642720105965],0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,French,[48.7],[5260000000.0],0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,Greece,2001-09-13,,,,,,,,,,,,,Lars von Trier,[11800000.0],"Dominique Aury,Lars von Trier","[381000.0, 1750000.0]","Inger Hvidtfeldt,Annette Linnet,Carl-Henrik Trier,Lars von Trier,Jenni Dick,Brigitte Pelissier","Inger Hvidtfeldt,Annette Linnet,Carl-Henrik Trier","The Woman,Menthe,The Gardener,The Driver,The Old Lady,Voice of The Woman (voice)","[13100.0, 2000000.0, 386000.0, 151000.0, 441000.0, 3040000.0]",,,,,{},0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,5.0,162.0,4.2,4.0,,,,,31.5,51.0,4.3,7.0,7.4,12.0,9.3,15.0,19.1,31.0,6.2,10.0,3.7,6.0,7.4,12.0,3.7,6.0,7.4,12.0,4.8,6.0,4.6,43.0,5.1,83.0,162.0,5.0,,,10.0,5.0,83.0,5.4,37.0,3.5,106.0,5.1,,,9.0,5.2,66.0,5.6,29.0,3.6,24.0,4.2,,,1.0,4.0,16.0,4.5,7.0,3.0

It's February, 1978; the winter is harsh, and for ten years Roberto's been the super of an apartment building, firing up the boiler, repairing windows, moving bags of garbage.

Amar goes as Dayal, and Dayal goes as Amar, as Amar is not sure if a step-mother will be able to bestow care and love as a real mother. They arrive at the household of Durga, Shanti Swarup, Renu, Sheela, and their servant Geeta. They begin to settle down, Dayal in a spacious room, and Amar in the servant's quarters, which consists of an untidy room with no electricity. It is not long before Amar finds out that he is attracted to Geeta, and not to the two sisters, but in his present state, he cannot reveal himself, and openly propose marriage.

The youth, however, takes his strength seriously, eventually defeating a name wrestler in a fair match. Angered circus manager fires him; he leaves happily due to two wrestler brothers who were harassing him. The wrestler goes on to fame, performing in the world's top arenas, and one day is serenaded by a tenor from the crowd. Fame brings him women and admirers but he is uncompromising on his profession. He has his revenge on one of his tormentors defeating him in the ring. One day, attending a game in a tuxedo, he is challenged by another of the brothers and drawn into a brutal game, in course of which he kills his opponent.
